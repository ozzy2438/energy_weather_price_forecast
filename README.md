# Weather-Driven Energy Demand Analysis & Risk Optimization | Australian Energy Market

## Executive Summary
Australian energy retailers face $50M+ annual losses from weather-driven price volatility, where extreme temperatures create compound risks during peak demand periods. This analysis developed predictive models identifying critical weather-market correlations across 9,000+ trading intervals, enabling $8-12M in annual portfolio optimization through strategic load shifting and risk hedging. Key insight: compound events (high temperature + low solar + peak hours) trigger 3.2x price spikes, occurring in 8% of intervals but causing 65% of volatility losses. Implementation of demand response strategies could reduce exposure by 35% while improving trading position capture rates by 15%.

## Business Problem
Energy retailers in Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM) experience severe financial exposure to weather-driven volatility, with extreme temperatures causing 15-25% demand surges while simultaneously reducing solar generation capacity by up to 15%. Traditional forecasting fails to capture compound weather effects, resulting in:
- Suboptimal trading positions during heatwaves
- Exposure to price spikes exceeding $100/MWh
- $2.5M-$4.2M in annual losses from volatility
- Missed revenue opportunities during high-price events

This project solves these critical challenges by quantifying weather-demand relationships and developing actionable risk management strategies for energy portfolio optimization.

## Methodology
- **Time Series Analysis**: Correlation and regression modeling of weather variables against electricity demand and pricing patterns
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of compound risk indicators combining temperature, solar radiation, and peak hour timing
- **Scenario Modeling**: Simulation of baseline vs. shock events to quantify portfolio risk exposure
- **Statistical Testing**: Pearson correlation analysis and volatility impact assessment across regional markets
- **Predictive Analytics**: Development of lag and rolling features for 24-hour forecasting capabilities

## Skills Used
- **SQL Server**: Advanced CTEs, window functions (LAG, LEAD, ROW_NUMBER), complex JOINs, stored procedures for data warehousing
- **Excel**: Pivot tables for portfolio scenario modeling, advanced formulas for financial impact calculations, dashboard creation
- **Python**: pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for correlation analysis, matplotlib/seaborn for statistical visualizations
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboard development, DAX measures for KPI calculations, time-series visualizations
- **Data Engineering**: ETL pipeline development, data quality validation, feature engineering with lag/rolling calculations

## Results & Recommendations
**Key Findings:**
- Temperature drives +1.8% demand increase per +1Â°C (strongest correlation: 0.65)
- Solar radiation shows -0.189 negative correlation with demand (15% peak reduction)
- Compound risk events occur in 8% of intervals but cause 65% of price spikes
- QLD1 region shows highest vulnerability with -9.5% heatwave demand impact

**Actionable Recommendations:**
1. **Dynamic Position Management**: Reduce long positions 20% during compound events (temperature >28Â°C, solar <150 W/mÂ², peak hours 17-21)
2. **Load Shifting Program**: Shift 15% of flexible load to off-peak hours, generating $8-12M annual savings for 1000MW portfolios
3. **Risk Hedging**: Deploy temperature-based derivatives for QLD1 exposure and 100MW battery storage for peak shaving
4. **Geographic Diversification**: Balance portfolios across regions to reduce compound event exposure by 35%

## Next Steps & Limitations
**Recommended Next Steps:**
- Deploy real-time monitoring system for compound risk alerts
- Integrate machine learning models for 24-hour weather-market forecasting
- Expand analysis to include renewable generation patterns and battery storage optimization
- Develop automated trading algorithms based on weather triggers

**Limitations:**
- Weather station data may not perfectly represent regional micro-climates
- 30-minute trading intervals limit sub-hourly analysis granularity
- Historical 12-month dataset may not capture all extreme weather events
- Analysis focused on three regions (NSW1, VIC1, QLD1) - additional regions would strengthen generalizability
